<p>I enjoyed this assignment.  It has been a few years since I did rails
development, so I used this as an opportunity to brush up.  For me, the
most challenging part was getting back into the rails state of mind.  I was
stuck for a little bit figuring out which qualifier I needed for the
attributes.  Figuring out how to persist a 2d array to the DB, but
realizing that I didn&#39;t need anything for the primitive attributes,
since they were inferred from the schema.  Looking at it now, I would
probably have created objects for users and ships, where a game has many
(2) users, and users have many (5) ships.  This would make
authentication/security possible, and the backend can keep track of when a
user has completed setup (placing all their ships), when a ship is sunk,
and when a game is completed.  Currently, I would have to rely on the
frontend for that functionality, but they can all be inferred from the
available data, although it&#39;s not particularly secure.</p>

<ul><li>
<p>create new game</p>
</li></ul>

<p>GET /games/new</p>

<p>receives no parametes</p>

<p>returns the newly created game (client will need to use the id for
subsequent calls).  The board is initialized 10x10, with 0,0 being the
top/left corner</p>
<ul><li>
<p>retreive details of a game</p>
</li></ul>

<p>GET    /games/:id</p>

<p>receives the id of the desired game</p>

<p>returns the details (board state for both players, and damage counts) of
the game</p>
<ul><li>
<p>list all games</p>
</li></ul>

<p>GET    /games</p>

<p>receives no parameters</p>

<p>returns list of all current games</p>
<ul><li>
<p>place a ship</p>
</li></ul>

<p>POST   /games/placeship</p>

<p>receives the following parameters</p>
<ol><li>
<p>id: id of the game</p>
</li><li>
<p>player: the player whose board to place the ship on (1 or 2)</p>
</li><li>
<p>orientation: horizontal or vertical ship placement (&#39;h&#39; or
&#39;v&#39;)</p>
</li><li>
<p>shipsize: the size of the ship being placed (2, 3, 4, or 5)</p>
</li><li>
<p>xcoord: x coordinate of the top/left corner of the ship</p>
</li><li>
<p>ycoord: y coordinate of the top/left corner of the ship</p>
</li></ol>

<p>returns status and message of succesful or failed ship placement</p>
<ul><li>
<p>fire (take turn)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>POST   /games/fire</p>

<p>receives the following parameters</p>
<ol><li>
<p>id: id of the game</p>
</li><li>
<p>player: the player whose board to place the ship on (1 or 2)</p>
</li><li>
<p>xcoord: x coordinate of the square to fire on</p>
</li><li>
<p>ycoord: y coordinate of the square to fire on</p>
</li></ol>

<p>returns status and message of succesful (hit or miss) or failed (invalid)
fire attempt</p>
<ul><li>
<p>delete a game     DELETE /games/:id</p>
</li></ul>

<p>receives id of game to be deleted</p>

<p>returns successful or failed deletion</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Security - there is no authentication, so a user could make an api call to
see the other user&#39;s board, or the board in other convurrent games</p>
</li><li>
<p>When placing a ship, the app currently uses a naive approach.  It could
start placing a ship, then error out later, but will leave the part
that&#39;s already been placed</p>
</li><li>
<p>No tracking of ships that need to be placed, or have already been placed. 
Currently relying on client for that</p>
</li><li>
<p>No tracking of when a ship has been sunk, or the game is over.  It is up to
the client to see when max damage is reached</p>
</li></ul>
